# Supply and Demand Simulator

## Overview
The Supply and Demand Simulator allows users to explore the relationship between supply and demand for apples and bananas. Users can input quantities to see how changes in supply and demand affect prices.

## Features
- Simulates supply and demand for **apples** and **bananas**.
- Calculates equilibrium prices based on user-defined quantities.
- Provides insights on market conditions including oversupply and undersupply scenarios.

## Getting Started
To run the simulator, simply execute the script in a Python environment. Follow the prompts to choose a product and enter a quantity for simulation.

## How It Works
1. **Supply and Demand Functions**: The program uses lambda functions to define supply and demand for each product.
2. **User Input**: Users can select a product and specify the quantity for simulation.
3. **Market Analysis**: The program analyzes the relationship between supply and demand and provides feedback on market conditions.
